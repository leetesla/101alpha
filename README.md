The data used for this model can be found in [all data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qyKwCcTDitOWBV6SJKinrfRPUSp0Patn/view?usp=sharing). And put the data in the "/data" path.

## how to use

First run the file ALphaGenerate.py and data for train and valid will be added into path "/data". Features will be saved in hdf5 files, labels will be saved
in csv files. 

Then run the file model.py and you will get the result represented by kappa.

And you can modify the model configuration in config.py and parameters in Parameters.py.
